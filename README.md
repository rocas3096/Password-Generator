# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

I made this password generator to test my knowledge and skills in javascript. It also gave me a handy tool for creating passwords for everyday use that should be random, safe and secure. I learned how to properly use string elements as part of an array, creating functions with multiple conditions, creating loops within said function and filling in empty variables within said function.
